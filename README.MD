# BackpropTools: ESP32

This example benchmarks the ESP32 inference on different models. It is supposed to be used with VS code and the ESP-IDF extension (for configuring, building and flashing).

Note: Remember to disable the task watchdog timer (using menuconfig, or the VS code ESP-IDF extensions configuration panel) otherwise the execution will be interrupted frequently and the device will reboot
